# Installation
Run through these steps in order:
### Clone the template
At first, you need to clone this template on your local machine, use this on your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/mhmdtshref/typescript-express-sequelize-template.git
```
### Add environments files
You need to add environment variables to be able to connect to server port, host and database server. There's an example of env file in `environment/.env.example`. You should create a new file for each development mode, for example, for local mode, create a file with the name `.env.local`, then copy the example file content, and replace the variables values with yours.
